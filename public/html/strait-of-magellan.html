      At 52°S latitude on 21 October 1520, the fleet reached Cape Virgenes and
      concluded they had found the passage, because the waters were brine and deep
      inland. Four ships began an arduous trip through the 373-mile (600 km) long
      passage that Magellan called the Estrecho (Canal) de Todos los Santos,
      ("All Saints' Channel"), because the fleet travelled through it on 1 November
      or All Saints' Day. The strait is now named the Strait of Magellan. He first
      assigned Concepcion and San Antonio to explore the strait, but the latter,
      commanded by Gómez, deserted and headed back to Spain on 20 November. On 28
      November, the three remaining ships entered the South Pacific. Magellan named
      the waters the Mar Pacifico (Pacific Ocean) because of its apparent stillness.
      Magellan and his crew were the first Europeans to reach Tierra del Fuego just
      east of the Pacific side of the strait.
