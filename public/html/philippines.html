      On 16 March Magellan reached the island of Homonhon in the Philippines, with
      150 crew left. Members of his expedition became the first Europeans to reach
      the Philippine archipelago.

      Magellan relied on Enrique, his Malay servant and interpreter, to communicate
      with the native tribes. He had been indentured by Magellan in 1511 after the
      colonization of Malacca, and had accompanied him through later adventures.
      They traded gifts with Rajah Siaiu of Mazaua who guided them to Cebu on 7 April.

      Rajah Humabon of Cebu was friendly towards Magellan and the Spaniards; both
      he and his queen Hara Amihan were baptized as Christians and were given the
      image of the Holy Child (later known as Santo Ni√±o de Cebu) which along with
      a cross (Magellan's Cross) symbolizes the Christianization of the Philippines.
      Afterward, Rajah Humabon and his ally Datu Zula convinced Magellan to kill
      their enemy, Datu Lapu-Lapu, on Mactan. Magellan wanted to convert Lapu-Lapu
      to Christianity, as he had Humabon, but Lapu-Lapu rejected that. On the morning
      of 27 April 1521, Magellan sailed to Mactan with a small attack force.
      During the resulting battle against Lapu-Lapu's troops, Magellan was struck by
      a bamboo spear, and later surrounded and finished off with other weapons.
