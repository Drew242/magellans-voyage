      Heading northwest, the crew reached the equator on 13 February 1521. On 6
      March they reached the Marianas and Guam. Pigafetta described the "lateen sail"
      used by the inhabitants of Guam, hence the name "Island of Sails", but he
      also writes the inhabitants "entered the ships and stole whatever they could
      lay their hands on", including "the small boat that was fastened to the poop
      of the flagship." "Those people are poor, but ingenious and very thievish,
      on account of which we called those three islands the islands of Ladroni."
