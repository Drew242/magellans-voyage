      After stopping at the Canary Islands, Magellan arrived at Cape Verde, where
      he set course for Cape St. Augustine in Brazil. On 27 November the expedition
      crossed the equator; on 6 December the crew sighted South America. As Brazil
      was Portuguese territory, Magellan avoided it and on 13 December anchored
      near present-day Rio de Janeiro. There the crew was resupplied, but bad
      conditions caused them to delay. Afterwards, they continued to sail south
      along South America's east coast, looking for the strait that Magellan believed
      would lead to the Spice Islands. The fleet reached RÃ­o de la Plata in early
      February, 1520.
